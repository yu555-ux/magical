# FSN Compaction Policy

Compact the conversation history itself, not the campaign state, project files, git history, or a coding task log.

Runtime state may be provided only as exclusion reference. If something appears to be an established campaign fact, a completed scene event, a tool result already applied to state, or a durable rule, omit it unless it is required to continue the currently unfinished user request.

## Preserve only

1. The current unfinished user request or split-turn context.
2. User corrections to the assistant's framing.
3. Conversation-level decisions about workflow, memory, compaction, prompts, or narrative direction that are not obviously persisted elsewhere.
4. Open loops that require the next assistant response.
5. Artifact conclusions discussed in chat only when they remain actionable.

## Do not preserve

- Long campaign chronology.
- Setup steps.
- Scene-by-scene completed progress.
- Tool/schema error history unless the active topic is tool debugging.
- Files read, files modified, commands run, quality gates, commits, pushes, or git status.
- State snapshots or long lists of state facts.
- Repeated durable prompt/data/state rules.
- Exhaustive character, location, item, or offscreen-event facts.
- A checklist of completed tool actions.

## Required output shape

Use only these sections, and omit any section that has nothing important:

### Conversation Memory

3-8 bullets. Keep only conversation-local memory that will matter after compaction.

### Current Pending Turn

Only if there is an unfinished user request, split turn, or immediate next response obligation. Include enough context for the next assistant message and nothing else.

### User Corrections / Preferences

Only corrections or preferences that are not already obvious from the current prompt or durable project rules.

### Open Loops

Only unresolved conversational loops.

## Hard bans

Do not use these sections or formats:

- Goal
- Progress
- Done
- In Progress
- Blocked
- Files Read
- Files Modified
- Key Decisions as a broad project ledger
- Critical Context as a giant lore dump
- Tool/schema gotchas
- chronological campaign recap
- checkbox task history

Target length: 800-1500 words maximum. Prefer much shorter when there is no unfinished turn.
